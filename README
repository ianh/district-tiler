Need to turn long/lat points into US congressional districts?
Copy the 'tiles' directory into your web site and use the following code:

<script src="tiles/lookup.js"></script>
<script>
lookupDistrict(longitude, latitude, function (found, state, district) {
    if (found === "found") {
        // ...
    }
});
</script>

To re-generate the 'tiles' directory, compile and run main.go.  It takes as
input a shapefile of congressional districts (available from the US Census
Bureau at http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html) and slices
it up into tiles.  These tiles are adaptively sized and indexed using a
k-d tree -- see the code for details.
